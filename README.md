# ChatterBox

Chatterbox is a real-time chat application that allows users to engage in one-on-one and group chats. It provides a seamless chat experience with features like user authentication using JWT tokens, profile picture uploads, searching for users by email or name, admin controls for group chats, real-time typing animations, and chat functionality powered by Socket.io.

## Features

### User Authentication with JWT Token

Chatterbox ensures secure user authentication using JWT tokens. Users must log in or sign up with a valid email and password combination to access the chat application.

### Profile Picture Upload

During the account creation process, users can upload a profile picture in JPEG or PNG format. This personalizes their profile and adds a visual touch to their messages.

### User Search

Chatterbox makes it easy to find other users by allowing you to search for them using their email or name. This feature simplifies the process of starting one-on-one chats or creating group chats.

### Group Chat Administration

Group chat admins have additional privileges in Chatterbox. They can remove users from the group chat, name the group chats, and rename them as needed. This helps in managing and customizing group conversations.

### Typing Animation

The application includes a feature that displays typing animations in real time. When a user starts typing a message, others in the chat can see it happening, creating a dynamic and interactive chatting environment.

### Future Development

Currently, Chatterbox does not support sending images during chats. However, this is a potential area for future development and enhancement.
